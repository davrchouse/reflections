What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You need to initialize a repository to create a hidden git folder that will store and be able to track all your previous file verions as commits. However, it does not automatically create an initial commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory because it lets you choose just what files you want to commit. The repository is different because it contains not just your latest commit, but all the previous ones too (sometimes with different sets of files). The staging area lets you choose totally different sets of files on different commits and choose just the files you need for each logical change commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can just add those files that correspond to the logical change. Then make the commit and repeat the process for the next change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches are helpful when you want to try out a different version without worrying about messing with your original (like another language or an experimental feature). This allows you to modify and experiment with versions in the new branch without having to change your master branch and even merge those features with the master branch later if you want.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The diagrams allow you to quickly see how all the alternate versions/features are in progress and how long ago / how many changes have occured on the master branch since an alternate branch was created and modified over time.
